        <h1>cholas ( ad 850-1279 )</h1>
        <p>The Cholas became feudatories in Uraiyur after the decline of the Sangam Period.</p>
        <p>Vijayalaya was the founder of the Chola dystany.</p>
        <p>His son Adtiya and Parantaka I were the early Chola rulers. Their power reached at peak of glory under
          Rajaraja I and his son Rajendra I. Rajaraja I (985 - 1014 A.D) gave a severe defeat to Chera, Pandaya and
          Kalyani rulers and won the conquests of Gangavadi, Tadigaipadi and Nolambapadi located in Mysore region. He
          assumed many titles like Mummidi Chola, Jayankonda and Sivapadasekara. He built the famous Rajasrajeswara
          temple or Brihadeeswara temple at Tanjore in 1010 AD and also helped in the construction of a Buddhist
          monastery at Nagapattinam. Rajendra I (1012 - 1044 AD) conquered Bengal, Burma, Orissa and Andaman & Nikobar
          Islands. Rajendra I also acquired a number of titles like Mudikondan, Gangaikondan, Kadaram kondan and Pandit
          Cholan. He was also a staunch follower of Shiva and built a temple for shiva at the new capital
          Gangaikondacholapuram. Rajendra III was the last chola king who was defeated by Jatavarman Sundarapandaya II.

    <div class="about">
      <h2>Administration</h2>
      <h3>___________________________________________ Central Government ___________________________________________
      </h3>
      <p>The king was at the top of admnistration whose authority is reveled by the big capital cities like Tanjore and
        Gangaikondacholapuram, the large royal courts and extensive grants to the temples. There was a vast
        administrative machinery comprising various officials called perundanam and Sirudanam.</p>
      <h3>___________________________________________ Revenue ___________________________________________</h3>
      <p>The land revenue department under the Cholas was called as puravuvarithinaikkalam. Besides land revenue, there
        were tools and customs on goods taken from one place to another, various kinds of professional taxes, dues
        levied on ceremonical occasions like marriages amd judical fines. The residential portion of the village was
        called <i>ur nattam</i>. The main items of government expenditure were the king and his court,army and navy,
        roads irrigations tanks and cannals.
      </p>

      <h3>______________________________________________ Militry Administration
        ______________________________________________</h3>
      <div class="flag">
        <img src="image/Flag_of_Chola_Kingdom.png">
      </div>
      <p>The Chola army was consisted of elephants, cavalry, infantry and navy. The royal troops of the Cholas were
        called <i>kaikkola perumpadai.</i> Within this there was a personal troop to defend the king known as
        <i>velvaikkarar.</i> Attention was given to the training of the army and the military Cantonments called kadgams
        existed.
      <p> The Cholas paid special attention to their navy also.</p>
      </p>

      <h3>_____________________________________ Provicinal Admnistration _____________________________________</h3>
      <p>The Cholas Empire was divided into mandalams and each mandalam into valanadus and nadus. Mandalams were under
        the royal princes or officers valanadu was under periyanattar and nadu under nattar.</p>
      <p>In each nadu, there were a number of autonomous villages. The town was known as nagaram and it was under the
        administration of council called nagarattar. </p>

      <h3>______________________________________________ Village Assemblies
        ______________________________________________</h3>
      <P>Two inscriptions belonging to the period of Parantaka I found at Uttiramerur provide details of the formation
        and functions of village councils. The village was divided into thirty wards and each was to nominate its
        members to the village council.</P><br>
      <p><i>Socio-Economic Life:</i> Caste system was widely prevalent during the Chola period Brahmins and kshatriyas
        enjoying special previliges. The inscriptions of the Chola rule mention two major divisons amongs the Castes -
        Valangai and Idangai Castes. Women's position didn't improve and the practice of 'sati' was prevalent among the
        royal families. The devadasi system or dancing girls attached to temple emerged during this period. The temples
        remained centers of economic activity during the Chola period</p>
      <p>Both agriculture and industry florished. Silk weaving industry at kanchi also flourished. Commercial contacts
        between the Cholas empire and China, Sumatra, java and Arabis were extensively prevalent. Arabian horses are
        imported in large numbers to strengthen the cavalry.</p><br>
      <p><i>Education and Literature: </i>The inscrition at Ennayiram, Thirumukkudal and Thirubhuvanai provide details
        of the colleges existed in these places. Subjects like mathematics and medicine were taught in these
        institutions apart from the Vedas and Epics.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top:8px; text-indent: 11vh;"> The Ramayana composed by Kamban and the Periyapuranam or
        Tiruttondarpuranam by Sekkilar are the two master pieces of the period. The Moovarula written by Ottakuthar
        depicts the life of the three Chola kings. The works on Tamil grammer like kalladam by Kallandanar,
        yapperungalam by Amirthasagarar, a jain, Nannual by Pavanandhi and Virasoliyam by Buddhamitra were the products
        of the Chola age. </p>
      <img src="image/Rajendra_map_new.svg.png" alt="Chola Dynasties"><br>
      <p><i>Art and Architecture: </i> The chief feature of the Chola temple is the Vimana. The big temple of Tanjore
        built by Rajaraja I is a masterpiece of South Indian art and Architecture. Another notable contribution of the
        Cholas is the Shiva temple at Gangaikondacholapuram built by Rajendra I. The Airavathesvara temple at Darasuram
        in Tanjore district and the Kampaharesvara temple at Tribhuvanam are examples of later Chola temples. The Chola
        paintings were also found on the walls of Narthamalai and Tanjore temples. </p>

    <h2>Rajputs ( AD 650-1200)</h2>
    <p>After Harshavardhana, the Rajputs emerged as the powerful force in Western and Central India. Out of the
      political disarray prevalent in North India the Rajputs chalked out the small kingdoms of Gujarat and Malwa. From
      the eighth to twelfth century they struggled to keep themselves independent. But as they grew bigger, the
      infightings made them brittle, they fell prey to the rising domination of the Muslim invaders. Among them the
      Gujara of Prathihara, the Gahadwals of Kanauh, the Kalachuris of Chedi, the Chauhans of Ajmer, the Solakis of
      Gujarat and the Guhilotas of Mewar are important. </p>
    <p style="text-indent:5rem;"> Prithviraj Chauhan was a brave ruler over Delhi and Agra. Jai Chand Rathor was the
      last Rajput king who was defeated and killed by Mohammad Ghori. The kingdom of Delhi fell into Gauri.</p>
